    "Adapted templates to support both standalone mods and workspace-based setups detected by the CLI.",
    "Refactored Gradle-related templates to align with the new EverMod integration workflow.",

  ],
  "notes": "This release adapts all templates to the EverMod CLI 2.0.0 architecture. The new system relies on EverMod as a Git submodule, ensuring safer updates, better version synchronization, and a simpler workflow. Templates now correctly support both individual mods and workspace environments, and no longer depend on legacy local EverMod setups. This version is required for use with EverMod CLI 2.0.0 or newer."
